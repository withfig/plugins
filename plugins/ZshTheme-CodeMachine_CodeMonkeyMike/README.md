Hey Zsh users this is my theme, it...

  * Displays git info (Unmerged, Uncommited, Not Tracked, Branch)
  * User and Host
  * Path
  * Has prompt input on 2nd line
  * Displays symbol for Mercurial repo
  * Return code
  * Displays if connected through SSH
  * Looks awesome

To install with Oh-my-zsh just copy into themes folder and change .zhsrc file to have CodeMachine as the theme
