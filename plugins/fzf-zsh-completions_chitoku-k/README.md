## Extension

In order to add/override completions for subcommands to the existing completion,
define a function as in the following:

```zsh
# This function implements `kubectl view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig **`
# Function name must be _fzf_complete_(command)_(subcommand)
_fzf_complete_kubectl_view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig() {
    # Call preprocessors
    _fzf_complete_kubectl_parse_resource_and_name 2
    _fzf_complete_kubectl_parse_completing_option
    _fzf_complete_kubectl_parse_kubectl_arguments

    # Return status code other than 0 to fall back to default
    if [[ -n $completing_option ]]; then
        return 1
    fi

    # Call any one of completion functions; see source code as to their usage
    resource=serviceaccounts
    _fzf_complete_kubectl-resource-names '' "$@"
}
```
