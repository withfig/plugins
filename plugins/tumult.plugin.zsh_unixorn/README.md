## About

Tumult is an [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)-compatible plugin that adds macOS-specific functions and scripts to your ZSH environment.

Some of these are mine, and have an Apache 2.0 license, some of them were written by other people and just colllected by me - the authors and licenses are embedded in those scripts.

Tumult will check to see if you're running on macOS and not add aliases or inject its bin into your `$PATH` if you aren't. This was done to enable you to use the same plugin list in all your environments without polluting your `$PATH` with incompatible functions and scripts on your non-Apple machines.

You may also find the [git-extra-commands](https://github.com/unixorn/git-extra-commands) collection useful, or my [zsh-quickstart-kit](https://github.com/unixorn/zsh-quickstart-kit)

## License

The Tumult collection is Apache 2.0 licensed. Some scripts in the `bin` directory have different licenses - if so, they have those other license statements embedded inline in their source.

| `set-macos-hostname` | Set the macOS name of your machine. macOS may be UNIX-based, but the Apple eccentricities mean that no, `sudo hostname newname` isn't enough if you want the new name to be visible on the network for things like File and Screen sharing. |
| `set-mojave-disk-warning-threshold` | Mojave now pops up a warning when you're running low on disk space. Unfortunately the threshold they pick triggers a warning every couple of minutes on my MacBook Air. This script lets you set a different number of free gigabytes to warn at. |
