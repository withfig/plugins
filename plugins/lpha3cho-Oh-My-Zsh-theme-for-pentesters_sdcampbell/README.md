Install Oh My Zsh: https://ohmyz.sh/

Copy the file lpha3ch0.zsh-theme to `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes`

By default it's configured to include the IP address of eth0 for Internal network pentests, so change the network adapter in line 13 if needed.

For External network pentests, comment out lines 13 and 14, and uncomment lines 16 and 17 to include your Internet IP address in the prompt.
