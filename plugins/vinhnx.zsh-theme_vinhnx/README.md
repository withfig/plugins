# oh-my-zsh theme
-----------------
This is my modified theme from [themes/mgutz.zsh-theme](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/mgutz.zsh-theme) for [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) (zshell) with minimal effort.
Looks great when using with Solarized color scheme.

## Usage

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:vinhnx/vinhnx.zsh-theme.git
$ cd vinhnx.zsh-theme
$ cp vinhnx.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes
```

Then open you `.zshrc` file and change the theme name to `vinhnx`

Or edit with vim:
```bash
$ cd ~/
$ vim .zshrc
```

Change the line starting with `export ZSH_THEME="..."` and replace `...` with `vinhnx`

It should look like this in your `.zshrc` file after editing:

```bash
export ZSH_THEME="vinhnx"
```

hit write & save `:wq`, then restart zsh and enjoy!

### Tips*

Solarized color sheme can be found here, choose one that suits you, then install it.
- [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)

I personally use Console2  with Cygwin and Zsh, so I choose the scheme for my console2 which can be found here:

~ Happy hacking! ;)
