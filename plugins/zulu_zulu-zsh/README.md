Thanks for using Zulu. Zulu is a environment manager for ZSH, which aims to make it easy to manage your shell without writing any code.

## Features

* Easily manage your shell environment without editing files.
* Create aliases, functions and environment variables, and have them available to you at the next shell startup.
* Add and remove directories from `$path`, `$fpath` and `$cdpath` with simple commands.
* Install packages, plugins and themes easily, and have them available to you immediately.

## Requirements

* ZSH `5.0.2` or above
* git `1.9.1` or above

## Installation

Zulu comes with its own install script, which is the recommended method of install.

```sh
curl -L https://zulu.molovo.co/install | zsh && zsh
```

If you'd rather not pipe a script into ZSH, take a look at the [manual installation process](https://zulu.molovo.co/docs/getting-started/manual-installation).
