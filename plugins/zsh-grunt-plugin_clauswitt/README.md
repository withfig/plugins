#Grunt plugin of zsh. 

Has been tested on osx 10.8, with oh-my-zsh. 

Install by placing in your plugins folder of oh-my-zsh, and adding the plugin to your plugin list in .zshrc. 

The plugin is very hacked and uses grep and awk to filter the grunt --help output so that it can be used by zsh autocomplete mechanism.
